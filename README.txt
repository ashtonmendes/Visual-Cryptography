In stream.c, code within the functions 'generateKeyStream()' and 'generateKeyStreamForEncrypt()', was obtained from the following URL:
http://merlot.usc.edu/cs531-s15/homeworks/hw2/
The above URL contains a section called 'Key Generation for a Simple Stream Cipher' which describes a method of generating a keystream,
using the MD5() method of openssl. The code on the website belongs to Professor Cheng. I have made slight modifications to that code, so as to suit
my requirements.
